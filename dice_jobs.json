We are responsible for preventing identity misuse, detecting fraudulent and duplicate accounts, and enforcing policies against underage use. We operate at the intersection of backend engineering, machine learning, and computer vision to deliver defenses at scale-while minimizing friction for trusted users.\n\nThe Difference You Will Make:\n\nSolving Identity Defense Problems Including:\n\nIdentity Misuse Detection - Fraudsters increasingly use fake, stolen, or AI-generated identities to gain access to the platform. Traditional verification signals are no longer enough in the face of sophisticated tampering techniques like deepfakes and synthetic imagery. Our team builds advanced detection systems that combine machine learning, computer vision, and biometric signals to identify and stop bad actors in real time. We continuously evolve our models and systems to keep pace with rapidly advancing AI-driven attack vectors, ensuring Airbnb stays one step ahead.\nDuplicate Account Prevention - Airbnb's integrity depends on enforcing the principle of one account per person. We're tackling this using identity linking methods that combine graph-based analysis, embeddings, and device IDs. The scale, complexity, and ambiguity of identity data make this one of the most technically demanding problems at Airbnb.\nUnderage User Enforcement - Airbnb prohibits users under the age of 18 from accessing the platform, but verifying age accurately-especially across global markets and varying document types-is a nuanced challenge. Fraudsters exploit OCR weaknesses or use borrowed identities to circumvent our policy. We are investing in government ID parsing improvements, tampering detection, and more robust age inference methods to ensure compliance while minimizing false positives. This space also requires deep collaboration with legal and policy teams to ensure regulatory alignment and defensibility across regions.\n\nA Typical Day:\n\nTrain and deploy machine learning models for identity misuse detection and risk scoring.\nHands-on develop, productionize, and operate Machine Learning models and pipelines at scale, including both batch and real-time use cases.\nIntegrate advanced verification methods, including biometrics and NFC-based flows.\nCollaborate closely with ML, iOS/Android, and web engineers to deliver end-to-end solutions.\nWork collaboratively with cross-functional partners including software engineers, product managers, operations and data scientists, identify opportunities for business impact, understand, refine, and prioritize requirements for machine learning models, drive engineering decisions, and quantify impact.\nContribute to foundational infrastructure including secure data handling, image processing, model serving, and feature engineering.\nShape technical direction and influence the team roadmap through long-term strategy and investment planning.\nMentor other engineers and promote best practices to strengthen Airbnb's engineering culture and foundations.\n\nYour Expertise:\n\n9+ years of industry experience in software engineering, with a focus on applied Machine learning.\nBS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, a related field, or equivalent work experience.\nStrong programming (Scala / Python / Java/ C++ or equivalent) skills.\nDeep understanding of Machine Learning best practices (eg. training/serving skew minimization, A/B test, feature engineering, feature/model selection), algorithms (eg. gradient boosted trees, neural networks/deep learning, optimization) and domains (eg. natural language processing, computer vision, personalization and recommendation, anomaly detection).\nIndustry experience building end-to-end Machine Learning infrastructure and/or building and productionizing Machine Learning models.\nStrong collaboration skills and experience working with cross-functional teams.\nComfortable navigating ambiguity and driving projects from concept to production.\nExperience with test driven development, familiar with A/B testing, incremental delivery and deployment.\nExperience with computer vision systems (e.g., face detection, liveness, tampering detection) is a plus.\nExperience with the Trust and Risk domain is a plus.\n\nYour Location:\n\nThis position is US - Remote Eligible.

Most of these tickets are well-known cases when you need to perform some actions according to the template (disk space, plugins, etc.). Sometimes there are cases that require further study.
