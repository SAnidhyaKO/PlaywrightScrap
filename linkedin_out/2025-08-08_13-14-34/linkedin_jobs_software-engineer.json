When we started up, Crypto was a field reserved for specialists. Today, over 20 million users trust CoinSwitch to learn, purchase and invest in Crypto. That makes us India’s largest crypto app.\n\n\n\n\nOn CoinSwitch, users can invest in Crypto with a few simple taps, either as a one-time purchase or in regular intervals through an SIP. But simplicity is not a substitute for informed decisions. A CoinSwitch user spends 27 minutes on our app—to learn about Crypto and Web3 through our educational content and understand the market sentiments through CRE8, the Crypto Rupee Index.\n\n\n\n\nBut we are just getting started. CoinSwitch not only plans to double down on making Crypto accessible to everyone but is on track to become the one-stop wealth-tech destination for every Indian.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about CoinSwitch, find additional resources here: https://linktr.ee/coinswitchcareers\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Will Do\n\nYou will design and develop large-scale distributed services.\nYou will analyse and improve the efficiency, scalability, stability, and security of the platform as a whole.\nYou will act as the primary owner of one or more components while driving innovation in your area of ownership.\nYou will proactively research & evaluate new tools, technologies, and techniques to improve the value of the system.\nYou will work with engineering leadership in solving and architecting solutions for challenging or complex development issues.\nYou will work independently and handle dependencies with very minimal oversight.\nYou will take initiative in developing and maintaining integrations of best practices within the back end.\nYou will help identify systemic issues, and performance bottlenecks and work on design/architect improvements.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Should Have\n\nYou have 3+ years of experience in software development.\nYou have designed and scaled up the system.\nYou have a strong understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.\nYou are an incessant problem solver and tougher the problem gets, more fun you have.\nYou have strong command in any one or more of the following languages: Python, Java, Golang.\nYou understand the business impact of your decisions.\n\n\n\n\nTraits we are looking for\n\nExperience in a specific tech stack doesn't matter to us.
