Today, we have 2.7 million+ happy users on Jupiter.\n\n\n\n\nOur Insights feature today tells how much and where you’ve been spending automatically, even on your other savings accounts! Our Edge CSB Bank RuPay credit card is getting a lot of love for its head-turning transparent design, not to mention it being a rewarding experience. Our No-Penalty SIP and Daily SIP at Rs 10/- has helped scale our investments business and we have over 100,000 users investing on our platform to fulfill their money aspirations.\n\n\n\n\nWe've embraced cutting-edge technology, harnessed the power of data analytics, and assembled a diverse team of creative thinkers and industry experts who share our vision for a more accessible, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem. We’re now looking for like-minded folks to join the crew.\n\n\n\n\nRoles and responsibilities:\n\nDesign & build backend systems with high reliability and availability\nAbility to work independently and in a team with least supervision\nCollaborate with Product, Design, and other Engineering teams\nOwn services end-to-end—from planning to monitoring & scaling\nMentor junior engineers and elevate the tech bar\n\n\n\n\nWhat we’re looking for\n\n3-7 years of backend experience in Java/Python/Golang\nStrong background in distributed systems, REST APIs, microservices\nSolid experience with SQL & NoSQL databases\nHands-on experience with AWS\nProduct-thinking mindset & experience owning production systems\nAbility to solve complex problems & keen attention to detail\nAgile, fast-paced environment comfort\n\n\n\n\nWhy you should work with us\n\nWe like people who behave like owners, and we place a high regard on those who take ownership and see projects through to completion.\nWe take pleasure in tackling meaningful problems by understanding pain points and developing intuitive experiences that delight customers.\nWe appreciate those who can participate in healthy conflict and are able to commit to every decision as if it were their own. We value consent, over consensus.\nIn our relentless pursuit of excellence, we consistently set higher standards.

    "job_description": "About the job\n\nWe are looking for curious minds to join our engineering team at Procedure. We are a product development company established in early 2017. Before we dive into the job description, allow us to introduce ourselves.\n\nOur team is a mixed bag. Of the smart and the hard workers. Of the organised and slightly chaotic. Of the early risers and the burners of the midnight oil. We appreciate diversity and truly like having differing perspectives in the room.\n\nWe pride ourselves on being early adopters of the latest tools, libraries, and frameworks while delivering business value all the time. People who work with us fall in love with their craft. We have changed the definition of \"work\" for them.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of our beliefs about work\n\nWork is only 1 part of your life and not your entire life. We treat it as such.\nWeekends are sacred and not to be messed around with. You won't be asked to work on one.\nCommuting is a waste of time. Working from home saves you additional time. Go crazy with it.\nSide gigs are welcome. We believe there are multiple avenues to learn and grow. Why restrict it to only work?\nAsynchronous by default. Synchronous communication is expensive, so we default to writing documents and literature to enable asynchronous communication.\nGood things come in pairs. Errors get halved. Productivity, ideas, and fun get doubled. Learning gets accelerated exponentially.\nLearning from mistakes. If you are not making mistakes and learning from them, you are not growing.\n\n\n\n\nApart from work, we continually invest in growing you as a professional and a human.\n\nExtensive Boot Camp - get to learn, regardless of your experience, about Data Structure and Algorithms, LLD, HLD, DevOps, frontend, backend, and/or test engineering.\nBook club - broaden your horizons by picking up a book every month, and have fun doing so\nP1, The Half Yearly Tech Conference - here's where we explore futuristic themes to keep you informed about what's happening in the tech space outside our office.\nInternal Projects - where your craft, experiment, and learning take precedence over deadlines. Also, try out new technologies and domains.\n\n\n\n\nGrowth requires mentorship\n\nWe believe choosing a mentor is more important than choosing a company. We have more than a decade of experience in our respective fields, and will be mentoring you to become a better engineer and a coder. We will help you with domain expertise, product thinking, and problem-solving. Ask us how it has helped our ex-employees in their careers when you chat with us.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's it like here\n\nWe love debating over languages and frameworks, and want someone who can bring their opinions to these discussions. We love reading/sharing articles, podcasts, and tech essays. If you are someone who loves tea or coffee, Marvel or DC, Peterson or Zizek, or even something eclectic, you will feel right at home. Continuous improvement is at the heart of everything we do at work & outside.\n\n\n\n\nThis sounds good. But what exactly will you work on?\n\nSince we are a service company, you will have the advantage of working on a wide gamut of problems, technology & real-world world-wise. You will be involved in all stages of the product lifecycle. You'll never have to wonder why you are working on something because you'll always know it.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nWe carefully select our clients. This is to ensure we are always indexed well on challenging work. They include indie entrepreneurs, Series B/C funded startups, and big corporates.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the sectors we are working on\n\nHealthtech\nEdtech\nInsurtech\nSportstech\nFintech\nAnd much more!\n\n\n\n\nTrust us, there's never a dull day at work.\n\n\n\n\nHere's what we expect from you\n\nYou love coding and think of it as a craft. We wouldn't have it otherwise\nYou are a curious person\nYou love challenges and consider failures as a part of the learning process\nYou aren't complacent about your skillset and have a hunger to learn more\nYou like to share your learnings with others.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have made it this far, I think we should have a chat. Hit apply!"

But simplicity is not a substitute for informed decisions. A CoinSwitch user spends 27 minutes on our app—to learn about Crypto and Web3 through our educational content and understand the market sentiments through CRE8, the Crypto Rupee Index.\n\n\n\n\nBut we are just getting started. CoinSwitch not only plans to double down on making Crypto accessible to everyone but is on track to become the one-stop wealth-tech destination for every Indian.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about CoinSwitch, find additional resources here: https://linktr.ee/coinswitchcareers\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Will Do\n\nYou will design and develop large-scale distributed services.\nYou will analyse and improve the efficiency, scalability, stability, and security of the platform as a whole.\nYou will act as the primary owner of one or more components while driving innovation in your area of ownership.\nYou will proactively research & evaluate new tools, technologies, and techniques to improve the value of the system.\nYou will work with engineering leadership in solving and architecting solutions for challenging or complex development issues.\nYou will work independently and handle dependencies with very minimal oversight.\nYou will take initiative in developing and maintaining integrations of best practices within the back end.\nYou will help identify systemic issues, and performance bottlenecks and work on design/architect improvements.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Should Have\n\nYou have 3+ years of experience in software development.\nYou have designed and scaled up the system.\nYou have a strong understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.\nYou are an incessant problem solver and tougher the problem gets, more fun you have.\nYou have strong command in any one or more of the following languages: Python, Java, Golang.\nYou understand the business impact of your decisions.\n\n\n\n\nTraits we are looking for\n\nExperience in a specific tech stack doesn't matter to us. The general engineering mindset and aptitude are what matter more.\nTechnically strong and curious.
